The as-cast sample was subjected to homogenization heat treatment at 1100 °C for 6 h under an Ar atmosphere, followed by water quenching. The homogenized sample was cold rolled through multiple passes with a final rolling reduction ratio of ≈79% (from 6.2 to 1.3 mm). The disk-shaped samples (10 mm diameter) were prepared from the cold rolled sheet using electro-discharge machining. The disk samples were annealed at two different conditions (900 °C for 10 min and 1100 °C for 60 min) to obtain microstructure with fine grains and coarse grains, respectively. Finally, the HPT process was carried out on the annealed samples at different turns (N = 1/4, 1, and 5) using a pressure of 6 GPa and a rotation rate of 1 revolution per minute (rpm).\"\"\"\n",
