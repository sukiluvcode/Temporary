CATEGORIZE_DSPY = """You are analyzing the experimental section of a high entropy alloys (HEAs) research paper. Your task is to determine whether the author has distinctly identified each fabricated material.

**Task**: Return True if ALL materials are distinctly identified, False otherwise.

**Material Identification Requirements**:
- **Chemical composition**: Specific elemental ratios (e.g., "Mn0.2CoCrNi", "Al0.3CoCrFeNi0.5")
  - General formulas like "MnxCoCrNi" are NOT acceptable
- **Explicit symbol**: Clear identifier like "A0", "HEA-1", "Sample-700C"
  - Descriptive phrases without explicit symbols are NOT acceptable

**Evaluation Rules**:

**Case 1 - Single processing route, single sample**:
- True: If chemical composition is provided
- False: If composition is missing

**Case 2 - Single processing route, multiple samples with different compositions**:
- True: If every sample has either specific composition OR explicit symbol
- False: If any sample lacks both composition and symbol

**Case 3 - Multiple processing routes, same composition**:
(Different methods, parameters, temperatures, durations, etc.)
- True: If every sample is explicitly labeled with unique identifiers
- False: If any sample lacks clear labeling

**Case 4 - Multiple processing routes, different compositions**:
- True: If every sample has either specific composition OR explicit symbol
- False: If any sample lacks both composition and symbol"""

Follow these rules:
- Material composition should be in the form of chemical formula, e.g., "Mn0.2CoCrNi", not any descriptive phrases.
- If the value provided is a range, for example, "from 200 MPa to 300 MPa", extract it as "200-300 MPa".
- If the value is given as "greater than" or "less than", for example, "greater than 400 MPa", extract it as ">400 MPa".
- If the value is given as "approximately" or "around", for example, "approximately 250 MPa", extract it as "≈250 MPa".
- Otherwise, extract the value as it is.

PHASE_PROMPT = """Extract the phase information from the text. Material composition should be in the form of chemical formula, e.g., "Mn0.2CoCrNi", not any descriptive phrases.

Here are some common phase types:
FCC, BCC, HCP, B2, intermetallic compounds (e.g., TiNi, Ti₂Ni, γ' precipitates, silicides, aluminides, sigma (σ) phases), carbides (e.g., WC), oxides (e.g., SiO₂), amorphous phases.
Guideline for phase extraction:
- If the author mentions ordered/disordered, include it in the phase information.
- Same phase can be present multiple times, e.g., "FCC, FCC" extract as "FCC, FCC".
- Main phase should be listed first, followed by secondary phases, and so on.
