The HEA with a nominal composition of V10Cr15Mn5Fe35Co10Ni25 (at%) was fabricated using vacuum induction melting furnace using pure elements of V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni (purity >99.9%). The as-cast sample was subjected to homogenization heat treatment at 1100 °C for 6 h under an Ar atmosphere, followed by water quenching. The homogenized sample was cold rolled through multiple passes with a final rolling reduction ratio of ≈79% (from 6.2 to 1.3 mm). The disk-shaped samples (10 mm diameter) were prepared from the cold rolled sheet using electro-discharge machining. The disk samples were annealed at two different conditions (900 °C for 10 min and 1100 °C for 60 min) to obtain microstructure with fine grains and coarse grains, respectively. Finally, the HPT process was carried out on the annealed samples at different turns (N = 1/4, 1, and 5) using a pressure of 6 GPa and a rotation rate of 1 revolution per minute (rpm)label.

The miniature-tensile specimens (a gauge length of 1.5 mm, a gauge width of 1 mm, and a thickness of 0.7 mm) were cut from the HPT disc using electro-discharge machining. The tensile specimens were cut from the disk, such that a gauge length of 1.5 mm is located 2.5 mm away from the HPT disc center. Room temperature tensile tests were carried out at a quasi-static strain rate of 1 × 10-3 s-1 using a universal testing machine (Instron 1361, Instron Crop.. USA). The tensile samples were sprayed with black and white speckles on the specimen surface before tensile testing, and a digital image correlation method with an optical 3D deformation analysis (DIC; ARAMIS v6.1, GOM Optical Tech.) was used to measure the tensile strain. Vickers microhardness tests on the HPT samples were performed across the radial direction by applying a load of 500 g and a holding time of 10 s.

Figure shows the XRD patterns of fine-grained (FG) and coarse-grained (CG) samples before HPT processing (N = 0) and after five turns of HPT processing (N = 5). The XRD patterns of the annealed sample show a single FCC phase with no secondary phases, which confirms the thermodynamic calculations reported earlier for this HEA. The XRD patterns of HPT-processed samples also show a single FCC phase, indicating no evidence of phase transformation after HPT. Also, HPT processing leads to a significant peak broadening of XRD patterns, indicating grain refinement and lattice strain.
Figure shows the bright-field (BF) TEM images of the FG sample after 1/4 turn (Figure a) and 1 turn (Figure b) of HPT processing. The BF TEM image of the FG sample after 1/4 turn shows a high density of tangled dislocations (Figure a). The fact that accumulation of dislocations can occur within the grains could be because of the planar dislocation-slip modes.. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shown in the inset of Figure a shows only FCC phase diffraction spots (taken along [011] zone axis), confirming the presence of a single phase. The microstructure of the FG sample after one turn of HPT (Figure b) shows significant grain refinement with an average size of ≈100 nm. Correspondingly, the SAED pattern of one turn shows the concentric FCC ring pattern, indicating nanograins with high-angle grain boundaries. The strain contrast observed in nanograins can be related to the accumulation of dislocations.

The Co30Cr20Fe18Ni14Mn18 alloy was prepared by vacuum suspension melting in an argon atmosphere using high-purity metals Co, Cr, Fe, Ni and Mn ( > 99.9 wt.%). A 3 kg ingot (ϕ60 mm × 130 mm) was repeatedly melted seven times to eliminate compositional segregation (Fig. S2). The cast alloy was homogenized at 1200 °C for 24 h. The homogenized alloy was then cold rolled to plate form and annealed at 900 °C for 5 h. After that, the plate was cold rolled again to a thickness reduction of ~80% to 1.2 mm, annealed at 730, 780 and 820 °C for 10 min and then water quenched. The plate samples were designated RA-730, RA-780 and RA-820, respectively. Fig. S3 illustrates the thermomechanical processing of the alloy.

Fig. 3 presents mechanical testing and analysis of the Co30Cr20Fe18Ni14Mn18 alloy. Fig. 3(a) shows the tensile engineering stress-strain curves of four samples after different heat treatments. The RA-730 sample showed the highest yield strength ( σ y = 1300 MPa), and the RA-820 sample showed the highest tensile elongation to failure ( ε f = 56%), but the RA-780 sample showed the best combination of strength and ductility, with a yield strength of 980 MPa and a ductility of 48% tensile elongation to failure. The RA-780 sample also exhibited the highest strain hardening effect among all the samples, with a strength increase of 405 MPa from the yield strength to reach an ultimate tensile strength of 1385 MPa.

The CoCuFeMnNi alloy was obtained by vacuum arc remelting (VAR) of pure raw materials under low-pressure pure Ar atmosphere (450 mbar). The obtained buttons were remelted 6 times inside water-cooled copper crucible to ensure compositional homogeneity. Thereafter, the alloy was cold pressed to improve its workability and finally cold rolled into 1 mm thick laminas (90% cold work). The obtained samples were solution treated under Ar atmosphere at 1000 °C for 1 h and quenched in water. Such temperature was selected to obtain a single phase FCC microstructure: in fact, available CALPHAD simulations indicate that at 1000 °C the alloy falls well within a single FCC phase field.
Laser welding was performed in bead-on-plate configuration by means of an active fiber laser (mod. YLR300/3000 by IPG Photonics). The main features of the laser source are listed in Table , while the associated power distribution and laser beam caustic are depicted in Figure . Flowing Ar at a pressure of 2 bar was used as shielding gas during the experiments. Laser power was kept constant at 300 W (the maximum power of the used laser source), to maximize the productivity in the view of a possible real application of the process. On the contrary, beam focusing and scanning speed were varied according to a full factorial design, as reported in Table , to find the most suitable process condition. The effect of the varied process parameters was correlated to the main geometrical features of the welded bead, namely penetration depth and top width

Mechanical behavior of the base and the welded alloy was assessed in tensile conditions, resulting in the stress - strain curves, reported in Figure . It is immediately evident that the mechanical response in both conditions was extremely similar. All samples were characterized by an elastic modulus of 146 GPa; yielding took place at 259.4 ± 2,3 MPa in the BM and was almost negligibly decreased to 255.9 ± 3.5 MPa after welding; finally, the ultimate tensile strength was found to be 580.3 ± 4,1 MPa and 576.4 ± 1,6 MPa in base and welded conditions, respectively. Failure happened at a deformation of 28.3 ± 0.4% in the BM and at 29.0 ± 0.2% after welding. It shall be strongly underlined that, as shown in Figure , failure of welded samples did not take place inside the welded bead nor in the HAZ, but rather in the BM. As a consequence, fracture surfaces, which lied at 45° with respect to the loading direction, were homogeneous in both base and welded samples (Figure ): their morphology is characterized by rather deep dimples and shows no cleavage planes, confirming that a ductile failure of the tensile samples took place after considerable elongation. The fact that failure has never taken place in the welded bead confirms the results of hardness tests (Figure ), which showed that mechanical resistance is locally improved in the welded bead, probably due to solidification-induced stresses and the emergence of the second Cu-rich phase. Moreover, tensile tests allow confirming the extreme soundness of the obtained joint, as no critical defect was induced. This suggests that laser beam welding may be used to process the high entropy alloy at hand in the view of structural applications, as the mechanical resistance and the ductility offered by the joint are equivalent to the ones characterizing the annealed material.

NCATB (Fe-27.5Ni-17.5Co-10.5Al-2.2Ta-0.04B) (at.%) samples were produced by arc-melting a mixture high purity of raw materials (over 99.9 wt.%) in an argon atmosphere (Ti as getter for residual oxygen). The following detailed heat-treatment steps are described in our previous article [27] with additional aging (600 °C, 2-5 h). Tensile test samples with a gauge length of 20 mm and a cross-section of 2.4 × 0.5 (mm2) were produced by EDM. Before tension test at room temperature, samples were carefully ground and polished to a mirror surface with SiC papers and suspension solutions. In order to measure back-stress, additional loading-unloading-reloading (LUR) cyclic tension tests were conducted.

The strain rate is set up as 5 × 10-4/s.
The tensile behavior of HL-NCATB before and after aging are presented in Fig. 2 a. In the engineering stress-strain curves of NCATB specimens, NCATB-2 can attain an ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of ~1.4 GPa with total elongation strain of ~ 30%, which gives the best combination of strength and ductility. SEM micrographs of the tensile fracture surfaces of NCATB-2 are presented in Fig. 2b and c, which exhibit clear evidence of transgranular ductile fracture. The selected areas with higher magnification show that the fracture surface of this sample is slanted at roughly 45° to the tensile direction, which is related to the plane of maximum shear stress and contains ductile microvoids. On the other hand, NCATB-5 shows a yield strength of ~1.1 GPa and an ultrahigh UTS of ~1.7 GPa with fracture elongation over 10%. The related SEM micrographs for the tensile fracture surfaces of NCATB-5 are presented in Supplementary Fig. S3, which also show transgranular fracture but contain larger ductile microvoids. In comparison with another solutionized NCATB specimen (annealed at 1050 °C for 30 min, composed of ultrafine grains + fine grains, UTS ~1.05 GPa, fracture elongation ~23%, microstructure presented in Supplementary Fig. S1) showing the highest UTS in our previous study [27], the NCATB-2 sample shows ~25% increase both in UTS and total elongation. Considering the solvus temperature of γ′ precipitates in the current matrix is over 950 °C [38,39], both NCATB-2 and NCATB-5 may lead to interesting intermediate temperature applications, depending on other features, such as precipitates and grain boundary stability.

All the Cantor alloy, Si10 HEA, and Si12 HEA were prepared via arc melting of high-purity elements (purity > 99.9%) under an argon gas atmosphere, and the melting was repeated more than five times to ensure chemical homogenization. The as-cast ingots were homogenized at 1423 K for 12 h under a high-purity argon gas atmosphere, followed by water quenching to ambient temperature. The ingots were then hot-compressed to 3 mm-thick plates (50% reduction in thickness) at 1373 K in air, followed by water quenching. The oxide layers were removed by grinding and then the plates were cold rolled to 1.8 mm (40% reduction in thickness) at room temperature. Finally, the samples were annealed at 1373 K for a short period (Cantor, 10 min; Si10 HEA and Si12 HEA, 2 min), followed by water quenching to ambient temperature, to obtain recrystallized microstructures with grain sizes of approximately 60 μm (similar for the three alloys, see Fig. 1 and Table 2). The grain sizes were determined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-7100F) equipped with an electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) detector. The observations were made at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV, and the EBSD data were analyzed using OIM analysis software (version 7.0).

We first report their impressive behavior in standard tensile tests, to make the point that their simultaneous elevation of strength and ductility, with respect to the base Cantor alloy, is attractive and worthy of detailed investigation (to be pursued in the succeeding sub-sections). Fig. 2 a shows the tensile stress-strain curves of the HEAs at room temperature. Here, the alloys being compared have almost identical grain sizes (Fig. 1 and Table 2). The 0.2% offset yield strength increased from 201 MPa (Cantor alloy) to 306 MPa (Si10 HEA) and 332 MPa (Si12 HEA). The ultimate tensile strength has been raised from 543 MPa (Cantor alloy) to 792 MPa (Si10 HEA) and 843 MPa (Si12 HEA). Of special note is that the Si-substituted HEAs exhibit a very high strain-hardening rate, as shown in Fig. 2b, which only slowly decreases during tensile deformation. This delays the initiation of necking to 60% true strain when the strain hardening rate (the upper purple curve) intersects the true stress curve (the lower purple stress-strain curve), as known from the Considere criterion. The engineering uniform tensile strain is as high as ~85%, whereas the total tensile strain to failure reaches almost 100%, both exceeding the best of all known metals at room temperature. Compared with the Cantor alloy, this percent elongation is approximately 30% higher. Similarly, a Ge-containing HEA (Fig. S7) also exhibited such simultaneously enhanced strength and ductility. The mechanical properties for both the Si- and Ge- substituted HEAs could be improved even more via further optimization of composition and thermomechanical processing. Previously, replacing Mn with Pd in the Cantor alloy enhanced the yield and ultimate tensile strengths but decreased the tensile elongation [6]. Overall, the combination of strength and tensile ductility of the Si-containing HEAs, as indicated in Fig. 2c, is unprecedented compared with other single- or multiple- phase HEAs and conventional alloys [52]. Fig. 2d compares the changes in strength and ductility of FCC HEAs tailored using metallic elements in the literature with the HEAs containing metalloids (Si and Ge) in the present study. The addition of metallic constituents, such as Al, Hf, Mo, Nb, and W, generally strengthens the HEA while compromising its ductility [9,10,53-56]. In contrast, the metalloidal Si and Ge are able to evade this trade-off, with a synergistic strength-ductility combination that distinguishes the tailored HEAs from other metallic materials. Obviously, the increase in strength and ductility must have its origin in the micro- and nano- scale structure in the alloy, which we analyze in detail in the following.
